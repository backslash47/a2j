Release management for ki-a2j

A2J Releases should be controlled my maven now, although you may continue to use simple
ant build files for day-to-day development.

When the time comes to make a release use

maven<cr> to make the build
maven jar:deploy<cr> to upload the jar file to the maven repository


Log in as a user that matches your subversion username, check out project
mvn release:prepare
